# approximate-data-dependencies
We define a new notion of data dependency that is more robust to noise in datasets. Quite often, we find that the quality of functional dependencies obtained from a dataset are poor due to noise in the data. To overcome such problems we have designed a more robust notion of data dependencies that share a lot of similar properties to exact data dependencies and can be used to perform approxiate relation decompositions and size estimations, etc.
